I am an astrophysics Ph.D. candidate at Johns Hopkins University under the mentorship of Dr. [Claire Murray](https://cmurray-astro.github.io/) and other researchers in the [ISM* group](https://sites.google.com/view/ism-stsci/home) at STScI. I obtained a B.S. in physics and astronomy from the University of Washington working with Drs. [Jess Werk](https://www.werksquad.com/) and [Daniela Huppenkothen](https://huppenkothen.org/).


My main research goal is to understand how the exchange of energy and momentum between stars and interstellar medium (ISM) drives the baryonic ecosystem of galaxies. To do this, I use multi-band photometric imaging of nearby galaxies to characterize stars and map the interstellar medium.

This fall, I will be starting as a [JC Ryan Fellow](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/opportunities/fellowships-visiting-scientist-positions/jc-ryan-postdoctoral-fellowship) at the Center for Astrophysics. If you are a student interested in working on similar research, please feel free to get in touch via email.
