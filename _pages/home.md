I am an astrophysics Ph.D. candidate at Johns Hopkins University working with researchers in the [ISM* group](https://sites.google.com/view/ism-stsci/home) at STScI. I obtained a B.S. in physics and astronomy from the University of Washington.


My main research goal is to understand how the exchange of energy and momentum between stars and interstellar medium (ISM) drives the baryonic ecosystem of galaxies. To do this, I use multi-band photometric imaging of nearby galaxies to characterize stars and map the interstellar medium.

This fall, I will be starting as a [JC Ryan Fellow](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/opportunities/fellowships-visiting-scientist-positions/jc-ryan-postdoctoral-fellowship) at the Center for Astrophysics. If you are an undergrad/graduate student interested working on similar research, please feel free to get in touch via email.
