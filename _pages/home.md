I am an astrophysics Ph.D. candidate at Johns Hopkins University working with researchers in the [ISM* group](https://sites.google.com/view/ism-stsci/home) at STScI. I obtained a B.S. in physics and astronomy from the University of Washington.


My main research goal is to understand how the exchange of energy and momentum between stars and interstellar medium (ISM) drives the baryonic ecosystem of galaxies. To do this, I use multi-band photometric imaging of nearby galaxies to characterize stars and map the interstellar medium.

This fall, I will be starting as a [JC Ryan Fellow](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/opportunities/fellowships-visiting-scientist-positions/jc-ryan-postdoctoral-fellowship) at the Center for Astrophysics. If you are an undergrad/graduate student interested working on similar research, please feel free to get in touch via email.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
