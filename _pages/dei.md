Through graduate school, I have been involved in various student leadership positions. From 2022-2023, I served as the president of the JHU Physics and Astronomy Graduate Students (PAGS) where I organized department initiatives regarding teaching, pay raises, and officing, representing over 100 graduate students in the program.

I am committed to helping improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia. Following my term as PAGS President, I spear-heading efforts to investigate instances of examination bias and improve equity in department	examinations through discussions with department and university leadership.

I currently serve as one of the JHU representative for the [Astronomy Graduate Congress](https://astro-grad-congress.github.io/), which provides a common platform for graduate students to discuss issues regarding graduate education in astronomy.

I am also a senate member of the [Gender Minorities and Women in Physics (G-WiP)](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/about/gender-minorities-women-in-physics/) chapter at JHU (est. 2022).
