title: Post-Doc Application Material

<!-- In early 2025, I learned that I was awarded the [JC Ryan Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/opportunities/fellowships-visiting-scientist-positions/jc-ryan-postdoctoral-fellowship) at the Center for Astrophysics.  -->

When applying for post-doctoral positions in the fall of 2024, I was incredibly fortunate that I had peers around me who were willing to share their sagely advice and successful applications with me.

Inspired by [Catherine Manea](https://www.catherinemanea.com/nsf) and other astronomers who have shared their applications online, I want to make my post-doc application materials publicly available with the hope that it will help other future post-doc applicants.
