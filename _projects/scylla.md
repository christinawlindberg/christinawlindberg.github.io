The LMC and SMC are nearby dwarf galaxies whose close proximity, and low enrichment (20-50%) provide opportune laboratories for studying the effects of low metallicity on small-scale physics.

I am one of the core builders for [Scylla](https://sites.google.com/view/scylla-hst/home) ([HST 15891](https://www.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/get-proposal-info?id=15891&observatory=HST)), a 500-orbit Hubble Space Telescope (HST) parallel imaging program (Cycles 27-29) to complement the HST Ultraviolet (UV) Legacy library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) survey. With high-resolution multi-band photometry of nearly a million stars {% cite murray2024b %}, we can (1) map the extinction curve and dust grain properties at high resolution in a diverse range of interstellar conditions; (2) constrain the multi-dimensional structure of gas in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds; and (3) measure the comprehensive star formation and chemical enrichment histories of nearby dwarf galaxies {% cite cohen2024a cohen2024b%}.


All data and data products are publicly released on [MAST](https://doi.org/10.17909/8ads-wn75).

I used the BEAST to measure individual masses, ages, metallicities, distances, and line-of-sight extinction for over 1.5 million stars from their multi-band SEDs.
With deep, high-resolution photometry, we resolve stars down to sub-solar masses (as low as 0.6 solar-masses), giving us unprecedented insight into the stellar content and formation history of these fields {% cite lindberg2025a %}. We also probe extinction across a wide range of ISM environments which will be used in future works to investigate variations in dust composition and constrain the fraction of CO-dark molecular gas at low metallicities. %we can gain a better understanding of the dust content in these galaxies.

Currently, I am pioneering a new method for turning stellar extinctions into 2D extinction maps. These maps will allow us to trace the parsec-scale structure of the ISM across gas phases, providing some of the highest resolution maps of the ISM ever in external galaxies, independent of systematics associated with standard dust emission tracers.

We compare this dust map with ancillary ISM emission tracers overlapping the same region: far-IR dust emission from Herschel (middle), and molecular gas (CO) from ALMA (right).
