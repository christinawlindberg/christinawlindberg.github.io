Massive stars are significant contributors of ionizing radiation and momentum, which can destroy surrounding gas in just a few Myrs. While most massive stars are observed in spiral structures associated with giant molecular clouds, we observe that massive stars also exist in the interarm regions of galaxies like M31, where relatively little star-forming material is observed at length scales greater than 10 pc.

By comparing the SED-fit line of sight extinction of massive stars (probing the sub-pc ISM structure) with other general ISM tracers (25-pc extinction maps, CO, HI), we find massive stars have on average the same amount of extinction at small scales, regardless of their location within a galaxy, indicating that even at 25-pc, we are still not capable of resolving star-forming ISM structures {% cite lindberg2024 %}.

The entire catalog of 40,000 massive star candidates from the PHAT footprint can be downloaded from [MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/phathighmass/).
