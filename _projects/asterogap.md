At the University of Washington, I worked with [Dr. Daniela Huppenkothen](https://huppenkothen.org/) at the [DIRAC Institute](https://dirac.astro.washington.edu/), leading the development of a new statistical method for inferring the rotational period of asteroids called [AsteroGaP](https://github.com/dirac-institute/asterogap) (short for Asteroid Gaussian Processes). Through a combination of Bayesian statistics, MCMC, and Gaussian Processes, we were able to develop a new method to accurately characterize asteroid light curve profiles from sparse photometric measurements {% cite lindberg2022 %}.
