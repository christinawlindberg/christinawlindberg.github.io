During my undergraduate at the University of Washington, I was a member of Prof. [Jessica Werk](https://depts.washington.edu/astron/profile/werk-jessica/)'s Student Quasar Absorption Diagnosticians ([Werk SQuAD](https://www.werksquad.com/)), researching the CGM2 survey, which seeks to constrain the cosmic baryon cycle of nearby galaxies. As a Werk SQuAD member, I classified thousands of absorption features from dozens of quasars observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cosmic Origin Spectrograph and contributed to [HST proposals](https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?id=15656&mission=hst) {% cite quastar %}.
